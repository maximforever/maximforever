### Hi there 👋

I'm a product-driven senior full-stack web developer, specializing in **intuitive data-driven UIs, and front-end performance and architecture**. I feel equally comfortable prototyping a new interface or developing new features for a legacy application. I'm involved in team learning and development, internal tooling, and hiring. I also regularly teach and write.

I'm currently helping build [Execute Program](https://executeprogram.com) (the best place to learn TypeScript on the web) and writing for the StackOverflow [blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/author/maxpekarsky/). In the past, I worked on engineering and product teams at [CAS](https://activestewardship.org/), [Bonus.ly](https://bonusly.com/), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), and the [NYC Mayor's Office](https://www.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/index.page). 

Outside of work, I'm always building useful tools. My latest projects are [TinyLogger](https://www.tinylogger.com/), a minimal blogging platform, [GemFM](https://gem.fm), a podcast episode recommendation app, and [Hackterms](https://www.hackterms.com), the Urban Dictionary for programming terms.

Want to become a dramatically better programmer? I attended the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) and can't recommend it enough.
