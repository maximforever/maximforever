### Hi there 👋

I'm a product-driven senior full-stack web developer, specializing in intuitive data-driven UIs, and front-end performance and architecture. I feel equally comfortable prototyping a new interface or developing new features for a legacy application. I'm involved in team learning and development, internal tooling, and hiring. I also regularly teach and write.

I'm currently helping build [Execute Program](https://executeprogram.com) (the best place to learn TypeScript on the web) and writing for the StackOverflow [blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/author/maxpekarsky/). In the past, I worked on engineering and product teams at CAS, Bonus.ly, Codecademy, and the NYC Mayor's Office. I attended the Recurse Center and can't recommend it enough.

Outside of work, I'm always building useful tools. My latest projects are [TinyLogger](https://www.tinylogger.com/), a minimal blogging platform, [GemFM](https://gem.fm), a podcast episode recommendation app, and [Hackterms](https://www.hackterms.com), the Urban Dictionary for programming terms.
