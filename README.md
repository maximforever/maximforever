### Hi there 👋

I'm a product-driven senior full-stack web developer. I specialize in intuitive data-driven UIs and performant front-end architecture. I feel equally comfortable prototyping a new app or building features on top of a legacy codebase. In addition to my engineering work, I'm involved in hiring and team learning and development. I regularly write and teach.

I'm currently on the engineering team at Greenhouse, and helping developers level up at [Execute Program](https://executeprogram.com) and the StackOverflow [blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/author/maxpekarsky/). In the past, I worked on engineering and product teams at [CAS](https://activestewardship.org/), [Bonus.ly](https://bonusly.com/), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), and the [NYC Mayor's Office](https://www.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/index.page). 

Outside of work, I'm always building useful tools. My latest projects are [Typerfast](https://www.typerfast.com/), an adaptive touch-typing trainer, and [TinyLogger](https://www.tinylogger.com/), a minimal blogging platform.

Want to become a dramatically better programmer? I attended the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) and can't recommend it enough.
